The makefile will allow you to run. `make demo` should work out of the box: it runs `make install` then `make run`. Default arguments will use the `lena.png` and output to `./test-images/output`. Installation shouldn't be necessary unless there are some issues with the virtualenv, which may happen since this was set up on a mac and you are using ubuntu.

I wasn't sure whether the thumbnail should also be grayscale. That is the case here but is easy enough to change. I tested it with loading `./test-images/lena.png` from the `test-images` directory (default) as well as another directory, and outputting both to the `./test-images/output` directory (default) as well as another directory.
